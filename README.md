- ⚡ Fun fact: Ambergris, often referred to as "dried whale vomit," is a rare and valuable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales. Initially soft and foul-smelling, it hardens and develops a sweet, earthy scent over time, making it prized in perfumery as a fragrance enhancer. Gross right?
